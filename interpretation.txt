From the MethodIntegrand, we can see in given intergral from -1 to 1.1 that with the increase of resolution all three method converges to a result that is very closed to the true value (error below to 10e-20). However with low resolution, Gaussian rule (using Chebyshev nodes) still has a better approximation (its numerical intergral with interval of 1 is the closest to the real value), where Trapezoid has the worse approximation. From the convergence rate, both of these three methods has a very fast convergence rate at the begining and Trapezoid & Simpsons rate converges to some constants. Trapezoidal rule has a convergence rate approach to 2 with all three function, while Simpsons has a rate approach to 4 with normal and Cosine function. The convergence rate of Gaussian is variance, which is very fast (above 7) at first and very slow (close to 0) at end. I think this is because Chebyshev nodes avoid the over approximation of Gauss's rule.

Extra Part: However something is different with -1 and 1. In this case, with cosine function and given C1, the integral range is symmetric. In this case, Simpsons and Trapezoid has very fast convergence rate at the begining. And doesn't converge to a constant rate of convergence which happens when the interval is -1 to 1.1.
